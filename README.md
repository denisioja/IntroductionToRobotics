# IntroductionToRobotics (2023 - 2024)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files. 

## Homework 1.
TASK: Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leveragedigital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

## Homework 3.
TASK: You will use the joystick to control the position of the segment and ”draw” on the display. The movement between segments should be natural, meaning they should jump from the current position only to neighbors, but without passing through ”walls”.

## Homework 5.
TASK: Develop a ”Smart Environment Monitor and Logger” using Arduino. This system will utilize various sensors to gather environmental data, log this data into EEPROM, and provide both visual feedback via an RGB LED and user interaction through a Serial Menu. The project focuses on integrating sensor readings,
memory management, Serial Communication and the general objective of building a menu.

## Sequence memory game
TASK: 4 leds (with resistors), 4 buttons, 1 buzzer, 1 led RGB. Un fel de Simon Says, dar pe leduri. Iti apare un pattern (generat random). Trebuie sa pui pattern-ul ala intr-un interval rezonabil de timp. Daca-l faci corect, scoate un sunet bun, led-ul rgb se face verde si dupa apare alt pattern. Daca gresesti pattern-ul, scoate alt sunet "negativ", led-ul se face rosu dupa care apare alt pattern.
