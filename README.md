# IntroductionToRobotics (2023 - 2024)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files. 

## Homework 1.
TASK: Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leveragedigital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

## Homework 3.
TASK: You will use the joystick to control the position of the segment and ”draw” on the display. The movement between segments should be natural, meaning they should jump from the current position only to neighbors, but without passing through ”walls”.
